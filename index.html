                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

                <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its
                    Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                    navigation.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or
                    perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

            <article>
                To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                JavaScript code:
                <code>function greetMe(yourName) {
                    alert("Hello " + yourName);
                    }
greetMe("World");
                </code>

                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the
                    characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers.

                    Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
                </p>
                You can declare a variable in three ways:
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax can be used to declare both
                    local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global
                    variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax can be used to declare a
                    block scope local variable.

            <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is
                            not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>and Object</li>
                <p>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions
                    with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.
                    You
                    can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your
                    application
                    can perform.

            <header>if...else statement</header>
            <article>
                Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else clause
                to execute a statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:

                <code>if (condition) {
            statement_1;
            } else {
            statement_2;
            }
                </code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See Boolean for an explanation of what
                evaluates to true and false. If condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement, including further nested if
                statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple conditions tested in sequence,
                    as follows:
                </p>
                <code>if (condition_1) {
                    statement_1;
                    } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2;
                    } else if (condition_n) {
                    statement_n;
                    } else {
                    statement_last;
                    } </code>
                In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition which evaluates to true will be
                executed. To execute multiple statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In general,
                it's good practice to always use block statements, especially when nesting if statements:

                <code>if (condition) {
                    statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    } else {
                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    }</code>
                It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be
                confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:
                <code>if (x = y) {
            /* statements here */
            }</code>
                If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put additional
                parentheses around the assignment. For example:

                <code>if ((x = y)) {
            /* statements here */
            }</code>

                <p>
                    A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the
                    function keyword, followed by:
                </p>
                <li>The name of the function.</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
                <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</P>

                <code>function square(number) {
                    return number * number;
                    }</code>
                <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that
                    says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                    statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the
                    function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                    globally or in the calling function.</p>
